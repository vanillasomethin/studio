# ALIVE Advertising Platform — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**ALIVE** (wearealive.in) is a kirana store digital advertising network based in Mangaluru, Karnataka.
- **Brands** — pay to run ad campaigns on screens inside kirana stores
- **Kirana store owners (Store Partners)** — host a free ALIVE screen and earn ₹500 + electricity/month
- **Shoppers** — see deals/offers at their local kirana store

## How Claude Should Work on This Project

### Plan before building
For any task with 3+ steps or architectural decisions: think through the full approach first, identify affected files, consider edge cases, then implement. If something goes sideways mid-task, stop and re-plan rather than patching forward.

### Verify before done
Never mark a task complete without proving it works. Always run `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build` after changes. If they fail, fix before committing. Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

### Fix bugs autonomously
When given a bug report: find the root cause, fix it, verify. No hand-holding needed. Point at logs and errors, resolve them.

### Keep changes minimal
Touch only what the task requires. No cleanup, refactoring, or added abstractions beyond scope. Three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction.

### Demand elegance on non-trivial changes
Before presenting work, ask: "Is there a more elegant way?" If a fix feels hacky, implement the clean solution. Skip for simple obvious fixes.

### Self-improve after corrections
If the user corrects a mistake, identify the pattern and avoid it for the rest of the session. Common traps on this codebase: wrong auth mechanism for store partners, proxying R2 uploads through Next.js, module-level Redis instantiation.

## Architecture

ALIVE is **one Next.js app** that does everything:
- Marketing site (`/`, `/store`, `/blog`, etc.)
- Brand onboarding + dashboard
- Store partner registration + dashboard
- Admin console for fleet management (`/admin` — Screens, Content, Playlists, Schedules, Reports, Monitoring tabs)
- Device/player API for Android TV apps (`/api/device/*`)

The only separate codebase is **ALIVE-Player** (Kotlin Android TV APK).

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|-------|--------|
| Framework | Next.js 15 App Router |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) |
| Animations | Framer Motion 11 (enter animations only — no loops) |
| Auth | Auth.js v5 (`next-auth@beta`) + Prisma adapter. Store partners: phone+password Credentials. Brands/admin: email magic-link. |
| DB | Prisma 6 + Neon PostgreSQL. Pooled `DATABASE_URL` for runtime; direct `DATABASE_DIRECT_URL` for migrations. |
| Cache | Upstash Redis — lazy `getRedis()` pattern only, never module-level |
| Media | Cloudflare R2 via AWS SDK. Browser → server-side proxy (`/api/admin/r2-upload`) → R2. Never direct browser PUT (CORS). |
| Payments | Razorpay (brand campaigns) |
| Maps | Plain Leaflet + CartoDB Voyager tiles (no react-leaflet — React 19 only) |
| Geocoding | OpenStreetMap Nominatim |
| AI | Genkit + Google AI (Gemini 2.5 Flash) |
| React | 18.3.1 — NOT 19 |

## Critical Conventions — Read These First

**Auth — the biggest trap:**
- Store partners use `localStorage` key `alive_store_session` — NOT next-auth sessions
- API routes for store partners must NOT call `auth()` or check session — validate storeId against DB instead
- Admin routes: `admin-password` header checked against `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var
- Brands/admin: next-auth session via `auth()`

**R2 uploads:**
- Always route through `/api/admin/r2-upload` (server-side proxy) — never direct browser PUT to presigned URL (R2 CORS blocks it)
- `maxDuration = 60` on the upload route for large files

**Redis:**
- Never `const kv = new Redis(...)` at module level — breaks SSG
- Always: `function getRedis() { if (!process.env.UPSTASH_...) return null; return new Redis({...}); }`

**Components:**
- `'use client'` must be first line of any file using hooks, browser APIs, or Framer Motion
- `import { db } from '@/lib/db'` — never `new PrismaClient()`
- No react-leaflet — use `async function loadLeaflet()` dynamic import pattern
- Always `// eslint-disable-next-line @next/next/no-img-element` before `<img>` tags

## Database Models

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `User` | All humans. `role` enum: `STORE_PARTNER \| BRAND \| AGENCY \| ADMIN \| OPS`. Holds `phone`, `passwordHash`. |
| `Account / Session / VerificationToken` | Auth.js standard. |
| `Store` | Kirana store profile. Map coords, referral code, gstin. |
| `Brand` | Brand profile. `walletPaise` BigInt (T2). |
| `Campaign` | Brand campaign + Razorpay order. |
| `Device` | Physical screen. `hardwareKey` from Android. `groupName` for group scheduling. |
| `Content` | Media file. `objectKey` = R2 path. `md5` for player cache invalidation. |
| `Playlist` + `PlaylistItem` | Ordered content list with per-item duration. |
| `Schedule` | Playlist → devices or groupName, with optional dayparting. |
| `PlayEvent` | Proof-of-play row. `tag` = campaign attribution. |
| `Bill` + `BillItem` | VoiceBill POS billing. `billRef` = "ALIVE-XXXXXX". |
| `Customer` | Bill customer. Token-based auth (randomUUID → localStorage `alive_customer`). |
| `Flyer` | Store offer flyers. |
| `AuditLog` | T2 audit trail (reserved). |

## Store Partner Auth Flow

- `localStorage` key: `alive_store_session`
- On registration: saves session to localStorage immediately
- On login: checks localStorage → falls back to `/api/stores/login`
- Session shape: `{ storeName, ownerName, whatsapp, phone, password, address, locality, city, pincode, lat, lng, referralCode, referredBy, agreedAt, screens: 1 }`

**Business rules:**
- Fixed ₹500/month per screen (clause 3.3 of agreement)
- Electricity reimbursed separately
- 1 screen per store only — no screen count selectors
- Referral reward: ₹500 per new partner who uses code
- Payout within 10 working days of month end
- ALIVE exclusivity within 200m of partner store

---

## Store Registration Flow

1. **Step 1** — Store name, owner name, WhatsApp (= username), password (min 6 chars), GSTIN (optional), Leaflet map, locality/pincode/city autofill via Nominatim, referral code
2. **Step 2** — Agreement preview, party block prefilled, "I agree" checkbox, submit → generates referral code + saves `agreedAt`

Form data persisted to `sessionStorage('alive_store_draft')` so navigating to agreement page and back doesn't lose data.

---

## Admin Dashboard

- Protected by `admin-password` header vs `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var
- `sessionStorage.getItem('alive_admin_pw')` in browser for API calls
- Tabs: Flyers | Stores | Campaigns | Screens | Content | Playlists | Schedules | Reports | Monitoring | Payments | Site Media | Roadmap

---

## Design Conventions

**Never:**
- Neon colours, glowing buttons, rainbow palettes
- Floating orbs, blobs, decorative shapes in backgrounds
- Heavy gradients for decoration
- Glassmorphism / heavy backdrop-blur
- Looping or attention-seeking animations

**ALIVE visual language:**
- Primary red: `#ef4444` / `#b91c1c` — CTAs and key labels only
- Backgrounds: `bg-white` or `bg-gray-50` / `bg-background`
- Cards: white + `border border-border` — no shadow stacks
- Headings: `tracking-tight`, `font-black` for hero numbers
- Positive/savings: `text-green-700` on `bg-green-50`
- Framer Motion: enter animations only (`fadeUp`, `stagger`)

---

## Brand Onboarding

- Flow: audience → locations → duration → creative → pricing → agreement → payment
- Promo code `GETALIVENOW`: ₹799 → ₹699
- GST 18% on top of base price
- Razorpay for payment

---

## Redis Data Model (legacy, migrating to Postgres)

```
stores:index   → string[]       # store IDs
store:{id}     → StoreInfo JSON
flyers:index   → string[]       # flyer IDs
flyer:{id}     → Flyer JSON     # includes base64 image
campaigns:all  → Campaign[]
```

---

## Env Vars

```

DATABASE_DIRECT_URL             # Neon direct (migrations)

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
