// Timing rationale — the two audiences want different things:
//   • Admin  → told immediately at the edge. They're technical, they triage.
//   • Partner → told only after a SUSTAINED outage. The offline edge is already
//     20 min after the last heartbeat, and the player's heartbeat is a
//     WorkManager job Android clamps to a 15-min floor (so Doze/jitter alone can
//     trip it). Messaging a shopkeeper about a 20-minute blip that fixed itself
//     trains them to ignore us; waiting for ~1h of real downtime means the
//     message is always actionable ("check the plug / the router").

 * hours. Any outage that starts and ends inside one of those gaps is invisible:

 * lost 5.4 hours on 2026-08-27 that way and it left no trace anywhere.
 *
 * The returning heartbeat closes that hole without depending on the schedule at
 * all. `previousLastSeen` is the row's value from before this heartbeat's write,
 * so the gap between it and `now` is exactly how long the screen was silent —
 * whether or not anyone was watching.

 * what covers the case where the sweep flipped the status but failed to write an
